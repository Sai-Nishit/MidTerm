1. What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?
   I have chosen the album Graduation by Kanye West. Released in 2007, it is the third studio album by Kanye West, known for its genre-blending sound, which includes elements of hip-hop, electronic music, and stadium anthems. Thematically, Graduation explores personal growth, success, fame, and Kanye’s evolution as an artist. The cover art, designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami, is vibrant and surreal, featuring Kanye’s mascot, the “Dropout Bear,” launching into the sky, symbolizing growth and moving to the next level in life.

2. What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?
   In my project, I will include interactive animations of the elements in the original Graduation cover art. Each element, like the “Dropout Bear,” flying graduation caps, and abstract visuals, will have interactive features. Users will be able to click on specific parts of the image to trigger animations, such as the bear floating into the sky or objects pulsing and moving. Additionally, facts and background information about these elements, the creative process behind them, and their significance in Kanye’s journey will appear as pop-ups or overlays. This combination of movement and storytelling will make the cover both visually engaging and informative, mirroring the album’s themes of growth, success, and evolution.

3. Is it interactive? time-based? both?
   The cover will be both interactive and time-based. Users can interact with different elements of the image by clicking or hovering over them, which will trigger animations and reveal facts about those elements. Additionally, there will be time-based aspects, such as subtle animations that evolve over time, like shifting colors or slow movements of characters and objects, to give the cover a dynamic and evolving feel. This blend of interactivity and time-based transitions will add depth to the experience and reflect the themes of transformation and growth present in the Graduation album.

4. What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?
   I would like to explore the integration of interactive animations with informative content. Specifically, I want to experiment with adding background information about the image and the inspiration behind the Graduation album cover. As users interact with different elements of the image, they will trigger animations while simultaneously revealing facts about the creation process, the artistic collaboration with Takashi Murakami, and the symbolism of various elements. This blend of visuals, animation, and contextual information will create a more immersive experience, allowing users to not only engage with the artwork but also learn about its significance.

5. Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?
   Yes, the project closely relates to the readings we’ve done on interactive design, visual storytelling, and the relationship between user engagement and art. The way I plan to incorporate interactive elements and animations into the album cover mirrors discussions we've had about how media can be designed to invite users to engage more deeply with content. The use of visuals, movement, and interactivity to tell a story, along with providing background information on the Graduation album, connects to the theories we’ve explored regarding how art and design can be used not just to captivate but to inform and immerse users.

Additionally, the blending of Kanye West’s music and Takashi Murakami’s artwork ties into our readings on how popular culture and postmodern art intersect to create dynamic, boundary-pushing designs. The concepts of using animation to guide users through an experience or convey deeper meanings are aligned with what we’ve studied about motion and narrative in design. By applying these ideas to the project, I’m drawing directly from the theoretical frameworks covered in our readings.
